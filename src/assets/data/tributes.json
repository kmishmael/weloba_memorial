And now that he is no longer with us, we still cling to that love which will live in our hearts forever. \n\nHis kindness, laughter, and unwavering support will forever be etched in our hearts. He gave so much of himself, everything really. He welcomed us into his home and his heart. Whether it was his warm smile or his ability to make everyone feel welcome, he had a unique way of turning ordinary moments into cherished memories. We cannot forget the dinners we shared and family moments at the shamba. He had that innate ability to gather people. He, simply, was the best. Truly a man amomg men. \n\nHis time with us was far too short. Far too short. Our hearts ache because we feel the big loss of his leaving. We just have to hold on to the love he shared and the impact he made which will remain with us forever.  We will forever carry his spirit and the lessons he taught us of love, resilience, and the importance of family in the depth of our hearts.\n\nRest in peace, dear Joseph. You will be deeply missed but never forgotten.\n\n",

He believed in people and went out of his way to lift others. I am a living testament to that.\n\nWhen I needed an opportunity, Joseph gave me more than just a job‚Äîhe gave me a chance to grow. He opened the doors of Nisomar Ltd, trusting me to serve as an IT/Documentation Officer. Working under him was a privilege. He wasn‚Äôt just a boss; he was a listening leader, a visionary, and above all, a genuinely good human being. He guided with kindness, corrected with humility, and celebrated our small wins like they were his own.\n\nHis office was filled with warmth and open doors‚Äîboth literally and in spirit. Whether you were struggling or succeeding, Joseph was there‚Äîrooting for you, advising you, and cheering you on.\n\nLosing him is not just a personal loss, but a great loss to everyone whose life he touched. The village has lost a gem, and many of us have lost a cornerstone of support and friendship.\n\nGo thee well, Joseph.\nYour legacy of kindness, leadership, and friendship will live on in our hearts.\nYou may be gone from our sight, but you will never be gone from our memories.\n\nFarewell, brother.
